## JavaScript Learning Repository

This is a Javascript repository to keep track of my projects on Javascript (that include some CSS and HTML), mainly based on game development projects that explores from basic to advanced topics that this programming language features.

The projects can be found at the [src folder](src/). The names of the folders are pretty self-explanatory of the project itself.
